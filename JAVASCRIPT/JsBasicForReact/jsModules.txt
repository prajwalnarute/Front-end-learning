 a module in js a file containing related code or chunk of code in js we use
 import and export keywords to share and receive code respectively across
 different module which means instead of having all code in same file we can 
 break the code into different files and we can use anywhere we want with the 
 help of export and import keyword

 Note:- we need to mention type = "module" inside a <script> tag
 in src attribute there we need to mention imported module in js.

 there are two types of modules 
 1. named module
 2. default module






 // exporting all code at time
 // Exporting code to sample.js file
 function msg(){
    console.log("good morning")
 }
 function msg2(){
    console.log("good afternoon")
 }

 export{
    msg, msg2
 }

 // importing all code with the help of  * notation from other file called sample2.js
 import * as file from "./sample2.js";
 file.msg();
 file.msg2();
